## Recommended Environment  
We recommend the following environment for running the code:  
- **Python** 3.8.17
- **PyTorch** 1.12.0 
- **torchvision** 0.13.2  

---

## Installation  
Follow the steps below to set up the environment and run the code:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yaojingzeo/DS-DKSVD.git
   cd DS-DKSVD  
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   
## Datasets

In this study, we utilize the following publicly available datasets for non-blind and blind image denoising, as well as image classification:

- **BSD (Berkeley Segmentation Dataset)**  
  [Official Website](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/) | [Kaggle Mirror (BSDS500)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/berkeley-segmentation-dataset-500-bsds500)

- **Set12**  
  [Download Link (HyperAI)](https://hyper.ai/en/datasets/17513)

- **Urban100**  
  [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshraone/urban100)

- **FMD (Flickr Material Database)**  
  [Download Link](https://sourl.cn/Wyqrui)

- **Br35H (Brain Tumor Detection Dataset)**  
  [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection)

ðŸ‘‰ *BSD, Set12, Urban100, and FMD are used for image denoising tasks, while  Br35H are used for image classification.*

## Dataset Preparation
After downloading, organize the datasets as follows:
Dataset structure:  
```
â”œâ”€â”€ Classification/  
   â”œâ”€â”€ dataset/  
       â”œâ”€â”€ test/    
       â”œâ”€â”€ train/    
       â”œâ”€â”€ val/
â”œâ”€â”€ Denoising/  
   â”œâ”€â”€ blind/  # Both synthetic blind and non-blind denoising are performed on the same dataset. 
       â”œâ”€â”€ real_dateset/
         â”œâ”€â”€ Confocal_FISH/        
         â”œâ”€â”€ Confocal_MICE/
         â”œâ”€â”€ TwoPhoton_MICE/        
   â”œâ”€â”€ nonblind/  
       â”œâ”€â”€ gray/    
       â”œâ”€â”€ test_set12/   
       â”œâ”€â”€ Urban100/
```
Make sure the data is correctly organized before proceeding to training or evaluation.

## Training and Testing

We provide scripts for both image denoising (non-blind and blind) and classification tasks.

### Image Denoising
- **Non-blind denoising (training):**
  ```bash
  python Denoising/non_blind/train_non.py
- **blind denoising (training):**
   ```bash  
   python Denoising/blind/train_synthetic or train_real.py
   ```
- **Testing (PSNR/SSIM evaluation):**
   ```bash  
   python Denoising/load_model_psnr_ssim_ours.py
   ```
### Classification
   ```bash  
   python Classification/train_class.py
   ```
